# Timeline EditorGracefulCamel<br> 2016This project utilizes the TimelineJS library with minor changes, and follows the same license (the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0).<br>### AboutThe Timeline Editor is implemented as a webpage. The TimelineJS library provides the ability to actually display the timeline, and this project simply adds a small amount of code to allow events to be added or removed from the timeline dynamically.Timelines created with this tool are done 100% client side, so no data is transmitted back to the server running the Timeline Editor unless you alter it to do so. Events in the timeline are lost upon reloading the page, but can be manually saved and loaded by the user.A few small changes were made to the TimelineJS library to allow a timeline to be created that has no events, but it remains almost entirely unaltered.<br>### Usage and ExampleThe files of this project can be used with any web server, or to test this on your home computer you could use Python 3 (Python 2 as well, but the syntax is different... look it up) by navigating within the command prompt to the folder you've put these files into and running 'python -m http.server'. You can then go to the website by typing 'localhost:8000' into your browser.
